---------------------------------------------------------------
This package is developed when I prepare the midterm exam in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
It based on the `multicol` package to create two column typesetting, and `eso-pic` package to
add the basic infomation, such as the title, the score table, as a background image.

USAGE
---------------------------------------------------------------
Download the zip file and unzip to a local directory, then have a look at the
`mathexam-main.pdf`, you can edit and compile it by
`latexmk -xelatex -shell-escape mathexam-main.tex`.
